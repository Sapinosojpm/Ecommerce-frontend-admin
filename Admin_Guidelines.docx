## 4. Setup & Configuration

### Google Login
- Obtain a Google Client ID from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
- Add the Client ID to your frontend environment variables (e.g., `.env`):
  - `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- Never expose your Google Client Secret to the frontend.

### Email (Gmail SMTP)
- Enable 2-Step Verification on your Gmail account.
- Generate an App Password ([instructions](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)).
- Add these to your backend `.env`:
  - `EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail`
  - `EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com`
  - `EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password`
  - `EMAIL_RECEIVER=your-email@gmail.com`
- Never commit these values to public repositories.

### Environment Variables
- Store all sensitive keys in `.env` files (not in code).
- Example frontend vars:
  - `VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000`
  - `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...`

---

## 5. Best Practices & Security Tips
- Never expose secrets (App Passwords, Client Secrets) in frontend code.
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data.
- Regularly update dependencies and review permissions.
- Limit admin access to trusted users only.
- Use strong, unique passwords for all admin accounts.
- Always use HTTPS in production.

---

## 6. Appendix: How to Replace Screenshot Placeholders

- Navigate to each page listed above.
- Take a screenshot (Windows: `Win+Shift+S`, Mac: `Cmd+Shift+4`).
- In Word, right-click the placeholder and choose "Change Picture" to insert your screenshot.
